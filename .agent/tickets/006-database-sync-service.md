## Objective

- Implement the mysqldump/mysql-based database pipeline outlined in **System Design › Database Sync Service** and **Implementation Blueprint › Feature 5**, enabling `push|pull db` operations (and future `all`) with confirmation and dry-run semantics intact.

## Scope

- Build a `DatabaseSyncService` that orchestrates mysqldump on the source env, optional gzip compression, transport over SSH when required, and mysql import on the destination; support local↔ssh, ssh↔local, and ssh↔ssh (streamed through the operator host).
- Integrate WP-CLI search-replace invocation on the destination when configured in the Movefile, and expose hooks for specifying php/wp-cli paths per env.
- Use scoped temp files when streaming is not viable, ensuring they are created under secure OS temp dirs and cleaned up via RAII guards.
- Respect dry-run mode by logging planned dump/import commands without executing them, and surface confirmation prompts (from Ticket 001) before destructive imports run.
- Wire the service into the CLI dispatcher so `movepress push|pull db` executes real transfers post-confirmation; update trycmd/unit tests to cover new messaging and failure cases.

## Out of Scope

- Rsync operations (`uploads|content`) and combined orchestration (Tickets 005 & 007).
- Low-level Movefile parsing or path calculations (Tickets 002 & 004).

## Requirements

- Pipelines cover all direction permutations, correctly arranging ssh/mysqldump/mysql/gzip commands and passing credentials/env vars securely.
- Dry-run output enumerates each stage (dump, transport, import, optional wp-cli) with enough detail for operators to verify without executing.
- Errors distinguish between missing binaries, command failures, authentication issues, or WP-CLI absence, and provide remediation hints per **System Design › Logging & Error Handling**.
- Tests exercise command/spec construction for each direction, WP-CLI invocation toggles, and temp-file cleanup logic; trycmd coverage ensures CLI flow enforces confirmations and reports dry-run plans.
